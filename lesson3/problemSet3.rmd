#GGPlot2 Diamonds Data Set##

We need to perform some analysis on the ggplot2 diamonds data set to answer some questions.

**Questions:**
- How many observations are in the data set?
- How many variables are in the data set?
- How many ordered factors are in the data set?
- What letter represents the best diamond color?

##Load the data##

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```
There are 53940 observations and 10 variables.
Ordered factors inculude: cut, color, and clarity

color ranks include D, E, F, G, H, I, J

Which is best, let's look at the included documentation.

```{r}
?diamonds
```
colour. diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best).  So, D is the best.
