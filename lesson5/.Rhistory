# for each of the names in udacious, including your name.
# 4. Run this next line of code.
mystery == 11
# Here we get a logical (or boolean) vector that tells us
# which locations or indices in the vector contain a name
# that has exactly 11 characters.
# 5. Let's use this boolean vector, mystery, to subset our
# udacious vector. What do you think the result will be when
# running the line of code below?
# Think about the output before you run this next line of code.
# Notice how there are brackets in the code. Brackets are often
# used in R for subsetting.
udacious[mystery == 11]
# Scroll down for the answer
# It's your Udacious Instructors for the course!
# (and you may be in the output if you're lucky enough
# to have 11 characters in YOUR_NAME) Either way, we
# think you're pretty udacious for taking this course.
# 6. Alright, all mystery aside...let's dive into some data!
# The R installation has a few datasets already built into it
# that you can play with. Right now, you'll load one of these,
# which is named mtcars.
# Run this next command to load the mtcars data.
data(mtcars)
# You should see mtcars appear in the 'Environment' tab with
# <Promise> listed next to it.
# The object (mtcars) appears as a 'Promise' object in the
# workspace until we run some code that uses the object.
# R has stored the mtcars data into a spreadsheet-like object
# called a data frame. Run the next command to see what variables
# are in the data set and to fully load the data set as an
# object in R. You should see <Promise> disappear when you
# run the next line of code.
# Visit http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Promise-objects
# if you want the expert insight on Promise objects. You won't
# need to the info on Promise objects to be successful in this course.
names(mtcars)
# names(mtcars) should output all the variable
# names in the data set. You might notice that the car names
# are not a variable in the data set. The car names have been saved
# as row names. More on this later.
# You should also see how many observations (obs.) are in the
# the data frame and the number of variables on each observation.
# 7. To get more information on the data set and the variables
# run the this next line of code.
?mtcars
# You can type a '?' before any command or a data set to learn
# more about it. The details and documentation will appear in
# the 'Help' tab.
# 8. To print out the data, run this next line as code.
mtcars
# Scroll up and down in the console to check out the data.
# This is the entire data frame printed out.
# 9. Run these next two functions, one at a time,
# and see if you can figure out what they do.
str(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
# Scroll down for the answer.
# The first command, str(mtcars), gives us the structure of the
# data frame. It lists the variable names, the type of each variable
# (all of these variables are numerics) and some values for each
# variable.
# The second command, dim(mtcars), should output '[1] 32 11'
# to the console. The [1] indicates that 32 is the first value
# in the output.
# R uses 1 to start indexing (AND NOT ZERO BASED INDEXING as is true
# of many other programming languages.)
# 10. Read the documentation for row.names if you're want to know more.
?row.names
# Run this code to see the current row names in the data frame.
row.names(mtcars)
# Run this code to change the row names of the cars to numbers.
row.names(mtcars) <- c(1:32)
# Now print out the data frame by running the code below.
mtcars
# It's tedious to relabel our data frame with the right car names
# so let's reload the data set and print out the first ten rows.
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 10)
# The head() function prints out the first six rows of a data frame
# by default. Run the code below to see.
head(mtcars)
# I think you'll know what this does.
tail(mtcars, 3)
# 11. We've run nine commands so far:
#      c, nchar, data, str, dim, names, row.names, head, and tail.
# All of these commands took some inputs or arguments.
# To determine if a command takes more arguments or to learn
# about any default settings, you can look up the documentation
# using '?' before the command, much like you did to learn about
# the mtcars data set and the row.names
# 12. Let's examine our car data more closely. We can access an
# an individual variable (or column) from the data frame using
# the '$' sign. Run the code below to print out the variable
# miles per gallon. This is the mpg column in the data frame.
mtcars$mpg
# Print out any two other variables to the console.
# This is a vector containing the mpg (miles per gallon) of
# the 32 cars. Run this next line of code to get the average mpg for
# for all the cars. What is it?
# Enter this number for the quiz on the Udacity website.
