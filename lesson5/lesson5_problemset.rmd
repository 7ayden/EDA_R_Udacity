```{r histogram diamond prices faceted by color}

# Facet the histogram by diamond color
# and use cut to color the histogram bars.

  facet_wrap(~color) 
  #scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual') is an option per instructor notes but I don't like the colors

# Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs.
# table and color the points by the cut of
# the diamond.

```{r scatterplot price vs ~ volume, color by clarity}
# Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs.
# volume (x * y * z) and color the points by
# the clarity of diamonds. Use scale on the y-axis
# to take the log10 of price. You should also
# omit the top 1% of diamond volumes from the plot.

# Note: Volume is a very rough approximation of
# a diamond's actual volume.

# The plot should look something like this.

# 'div' was used to color the scatterplot using
# scale_color_brewer(type = 'div')

```{r proportion of friendships initiated}

# Many interesting variables are derived from two or more others.
# For example, we might wonder how much of a person's network on
# a service like Facebook the user actively initiated. Two users
# with the same degree (or number of friends) might be very
# different if one initiated most of those connections on the
# service, while the other initiated very few. So it could be
# useful to consider this proportion of existing friendships that
# the user initiated. This might be a good predictor of how active
# a user is compared with their peers, or other traits, such as
# personality (i.e., is this person an extrovert?).

# Your task is to create a new variable called 'prop_initiated'
# in the Pseudo-Facebook data set. The variable should contain
# the proportion of friendships that the user initiated.

# This programming assignment WILL BE automatically graded.

```

```{r prop initiated vs tenure}
# Create a line graph of the proportion of
# friendships initiated ('prop_initiated') vs.
# tenure and color the line segment by
# year_joined.bucket.

# Recall, we created year_joined.bucket in Lesson 5
# by first creating year_joined from the variable tenure.
# Then, we used the cut function on year_joined to create
# four bins or cohorts of users.
